# fashion-mnist-ada-batch-implementation
This repository contains a replication study implementing the adaptive batch size algorithm (AdaBatch) from "AdaBatch: Adaptive Batch Sizes for Training Deep Neural Networks" using the FashionMNIST dataset. The project explores how these techniques perform on clothing classification compared to the original datasets used in the paper.
